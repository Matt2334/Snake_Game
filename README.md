# Snake_Game
This project is one of the most famous amongst early coders. The snake game originates from the game Blockade where a snake looking for food is controlled by the player. The goal is to collect the randomly located food in order to elongate the snake. The challenge when playing the game is to not run into the walls or into the snake itself. 

The game serves as a way for many new coders to practice a wide array of skills and also fosters  creativity. It teaches them not only about design but also about using Classes and Python libraries. 

This project uses the Python library Turtle to generate the snake, food, and scoreboard. Upon "eating" one of the food dots the snake will get a portion longer. Additionally, the script uses key listners to determine which buttons on the keyboard were pressed to move/change directions of the snake.
